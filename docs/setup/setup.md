# OpenOnDemand System

During this workshop we will be running the material on the OpenOnDemand training platform, however it is also possible to run this material locally on your own machine.

Because each OnDemand training environment is a specific instance, you will be given a link, username and password specific to that environment as you join the workshop. 

The OnDemandTraining environment has all the required software loaded. In this case, that is Nextflow. If you would like to install Nextflow locally you can follow these directions:

1. Download the executable package using either wget -qO- https://get.nextflow.io | bash or curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
    
2. Make the binary executable on your system by running chmod +x nextflow

3. Move the nextflow file to a directory accessible by your $PATH variable, e.g, mv nextflow ~/bin/
